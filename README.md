# Tic Tac Toe

Teach the computer to play Tic Tac Toe using reinforcement learning.

## About the Game

Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet strategic game where two players aim to align three of their symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid.

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against a random player or an AI opponent.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Play directly in the terminal.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid and unique moves.
- **Real-Time Board Updates**: Visualizes the game state after every move.
- **Reinforcement Learning AI**: The computer improves its gameplay by learning from self-play.
- **Use [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai/)**: Online logging of training progress of reinforcement learning.

## Reinforcement Learning

The AI uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize its strategy. By playing thousands of games against itself, it learns to make better decisions over time. Key aspects include:

- **State-Action Mapping**: Tracks game states and corresponding actions.
- **Reward System**: Encourages winning moves and penalizes losing ones.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balances trying new moves and leveraging learned strategies.

This approach demonstrates the power of machine learning in solving simple yet challenging problems.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jakobatgithub/TicTacToe.git
   cd TicTacToe
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install .
   ```
3. **Tkinter must be installed**:
   ```bash
   brew install python-tk
   ```
4. **Optional: get an account at [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai/) and log in**:
   ```bash
   wandb login
   ```
5. **Train one model for player 'X' and one for player 'O' by playing against each other**:
   ```bash
   python train/TicTacToeDeepQLearning.py
   ```
