## About the Game

Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet strategic game where two players aim to align three of their symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid.

---

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against a random player or an AI opponent.
- **Reinforcement Learning AI**: The computer improves its gameplay by learning from self-play.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Play directly in the terminal.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid and unique moves.
- **Real-Time Board Updates**: Visualizes the game state after every move.

---

## Reinforcement Learning

The AI uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize its strategy. By playing thousands of games against itself, it learns to make better decisions over time. Key aspects include:

- **State-Action Mapping**: Tracks game states and corresponding actions.
- **Reward System**: Encourages winning moves and penalizes losing ones.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balances trying new moves and leveraging learned strategies.

This approach demonstrates the power of machine learning in solving simple yet challenging problems.
