# Tic Tac Toe

A classic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using Python. This project serves as both an engaging game and an introduction to programming concepts like game loops, input validation, and game state management. Furthermore, a reinforcement learning algorithms is implemented such that the computer learns to play Tic Tac Toe by playing against itself.
